description: The classic science-fiction short stories of Jack Sharkey are set apart
  by their quirky, irreverent tone. In the amusing tale ""Double or Nothing, "" wacky
  inventor Archie and his long-suffering investor Burt stumble across a technology
  that they're sure will be the next big thing. Needless to say, things don't go exactly
  as planned.
